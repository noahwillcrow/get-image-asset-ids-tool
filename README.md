# get-image-asset-ids-tool
Decal IDs are annoying and mostly useless. Let's get the underlying image asset ID easily - and preferably with an interface to just do a list at a time!

# How to use
Clone this repository, open the index.html file in a browser of your choice (just so long as you can disable CORS), paste a newline-delimited list of decal ids, press the button, wait, copy, and paste!

Please note that you should definitely turn CORS back on as soon as you're done using this tool.
